\section*{Introduction}
This chapter explains a little bit of who are the major players in mortal society and can work for both cities, depending if you want to run a game on the First or Second City.

In running a game set in the First City, storytellers have the unique opportunity to introduce characters who belong to the rarely explored realm of second and third-generation vampires. These ancient beings, untouched by the white-wolf canon lore, offer a new level of intrigue, power, and mystery to the game.

As players embody these extraordinary creatures, they become the pioneers of their bloodline, charting their own path and unraveling the secrets of their origins. They hold a profound connection to the mythical founders of their clans, shrouded in the mists of time. This allows for the exploration of uncharted territories and the development of captivating storylines that deviate from the established lore.

The tragic fate of the First City adds an additional layer of challenge and complexity. Players must grapple with the impending doom that looms over their characters' heads, the knowledge that their grand city will eventually crumble and give rise to a new era. This sense of impending tragedy fuels their motivations and drives their actions, creating a thrilling atmosphere of urgency and destiny.

On the other hand, the Second City offers a different set of challenges and possibilities. Players can take on the roles of offspring of the famed clan founders, delving into the intricacies of their bloodline and shaping the future of their clans. With a touch of imagination and a compelling argument, storytellers can introduce new characters as second or even third-generation vampires, further expanding the possibilities and narrative scope.

By embracing these opportunities, storytellers and players alike can forge their own narratives within the rich tapestry of the vampire world. They have the freedom to redefine the boundaries, introduce new bloodlines, and challenge the established norms of the white-wolf canon. This opens the door to a world of creativity, where ancient legacies intertwine with bold new tales, and the fate of vampire society hangs in the balance.

So, whether you choose to delve into the mysteries of the First City or unravel the complexities of the Second City, remember that the power of storytelling lies in your hands. Embrace the challenges, seize the opportunities, and let your imagination soar as you create a vampire saga unlike any other, where the untold stories of ancient bloodlines come to life.

There are geographic distinctions between Assyria, Babylonia and the Cappadocia Region in ancient Mesopotamia.

Assyria was a region located in northern Mesopotamia, along the banks of the Tigris River. The capital of Assyria was the city of Assur, after which the Assyrian empire was named. This region had a more mountainous geography, with rough terrain and denser vegetation.

Babylon, in turn, was located in the central region of Mesopotamia, south of Assyria. The city of Babylon, with its famous Hanging Gardens, was the capital of Babylon and an important political and cultural center. The Babylonian landscape was characterized by fertile plains and valleys irrigated by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.

The Cappadocia Region, in turn, was located northeast of Babylon, in the central part of present-day Turkey. Cappadocia was a mountainous and rocky area known for its unique geological formations such as the famous "fairy chimneys". It has been inhabited by diverse peoples throughout history, and the Hittites had a significant influence on this region during the Mesopotamian era.

Therefore, each of these regions had distinct geographic characteristics, which shaped their cultures, economies and interactions with other Mesopotamian civilizations.
The Mesopotamian civilization, situated between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, flourished for millennia and left a lasting cultural and religious legacy. In this chapter, we will explore three prominent Mesopotamian pantheons: the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Cappadocian pantheons.

The Assyrian and Babylonian regions were relatively close to each other within Mesopotamia, with the Babylonian region located south of the Assyrian heartland. The Tigris River, which flowed through Assyria, also passed through Babylon, facilitating trade and communication between the two regions. This proximity led to interactions, cultural exchanges, and at times, political conflicts between the Assyrians and Babylonians.

Despite their close proximity, there were notable distinctions between the two regions. The Assyrian territory had a more rugged terrain, with mountains and forests, while the Babylonian region consisted of fertile plains and river valleys. These geographical differences influenced the agricultural practices and economic activities of each region. Assyria relied on herding, agriculture, and timber resources, while Babylon thrived on its highly productive agricultural lands and the irrigation systems built along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.

The Cappadocian region, on the other hand, was located further to the northeast of Assyria and Babylon, in what is now central Turkey. It was geographically distinct from the Mesopotamian heartland, characterized by its rocky landscape, volcanic formations, and unique geological features, such as the fairy chimneys. The Cappadocian region had its own cultural and historical development, influenced by various peoples, including the Hittites, Persians, Greeks, and later the Romans. While it was not directly part of the core Mesopotamian civilization, it had connections and trade links with both Assyria and Babylon.

Although the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Cappadocian regions had their own distinctive geographical features, they were interconnected through trade routes, diplomatic relations, and cultural exchanges. They shared a common heritage in the broader context of Mesopotamian civilization, and their interactions contributed to the cross-pollination of ideas, religious beliefs, and artistic expressions throughout the region.

In summary, while Assyria and Babylon were geographically closer to each other within Mesopotamia, they had distinct terrains and economic activities. The Cappadocian region, although located further away, had its own unique geography and cultural development. Together, these regions formed a complex tapestry of civilizations and interactions within the broader context of ancient Mesopotamia.

The period between 4000 BCE and 3400 BCE in Mesopotamia witnessed the rise of city-states and the emergence of early conflicts and warfare. While specific details of the wars during this time are scarce, archaeological evidence and historical records provide some insights into the shaping of these regions through conflicts.

During this period, the city-states in Mesopotamia were developing as independent political entities, each vying for control over resources, fertile lands, and trade routes. These city-states often engaged in territorial disputes and conflicts over strategic locations, water sources, and agricultural lands.

The wars and conflicts during this era were primarily fought using relatively simple weapons and tactics, such as spears, slings, and early forms of bows and arrows. The city-states raised armies composed of citizen-soldiers, and battles were typically fought on open fields or near settlements.

The outcome of these early wars played a significant role in shaping the power dynamics and political landscape of the region. Victorious city-states would expand their territories, exert control over neighboring regions, and establish dominance over trade routes, thereby gaining economic advantages. These conflicts also led to the emergence of dominant city-states that would later form the foundations of larger empires.

One notable example during this period is the city-state of Uruk, which grew in influence and power through military conquests. Uruk established control over neighboring regions, expanding its influence and initiating a period of Uruk hegemony in southern Mesopotamia.

It's important to note that written records from this early period are scarce, and much of our understanding of conflicts during this time relies on archaeological findings and later historical accounts. As a result, many details about specific wars and their impact on the region remain unclear.

Overall, the wars and conflicts that occurred between 4000 BCE and 3400 BCE played a crucial role in shaping the political, economic, and social dynamics of the Mesopotamian city-states. They contributed to the rise of dominant powers and the establishment of territorial control, setting the stage for the development of more complex civilizations and empires in the following centuries.
\section*{Conflicts}
The common causes for wars and conflicts in Mesopotamia during the period between 4000 BCE and 3400 BCE were primarily related to competition for resources, territorial control, and regional dominance. Here are some of the key factors that led to these conflicts:

\textbf{Resources}: The fertile lands of Mesopotamia were crucial for agriculture, which formed the backbone of the economy. City-states fought over access to arable land, water sources, and other natural resources necessary for sustenance and economic prosperity. Control over productive agricultural regions was highly coveted, as it ensured a stable food supply and economic advantage.  The conflict between the city-states of Lagash and Umma: This historical event, recorded on the Stele of the Vultures (circa 2450 BCE), illustrates a territorial dispute between these two city-states over agricultural land and water resources. It highlights the importance of resources in causing conflicts.

In many city-states, access to water resources is of utmost importance, particularly for sustaining agricultural activities that provide food for the population and support trade routes. It is common to find cities strategically located near river banks or bodies of water, as these sources provide a reliable supply of water for various purposes.

The presence of water allows for irrigation systems to be established, enabling the cultivation of crops and the growth of vibrant agricultural fields. These fields, essential for producing food and sustaining the city's economy, are often situated outside the protective walls of the city. This placement allows for larger expanses of land to be used for agriculture, maximizing the crop yield and supporting a growing population.

The rivers and water bodies not only serve as sources of water for irrigation but also play a crucial role in transportation and trade. They facilitate the movement of goods and people, connecting different regions and enabling the exchange of commodities. The proximity of cities to waterways enhances their accessibility and provides opportunities for economic growth and cultural exchange.

However, the reliance on water resources also brings its own set of challenges. Droughts, floods, and changes in water availability can have a significant impact on the city's agricultural output and overall well-being. Therefore, managing water resources efficiently becomes a vital aspect of city planning and governance. Systems such as reservoirs, canals, and wells may be implemented to regulate the distribution of water and ensure its availability during times of scarcity.

In conclusion, water is a valuable resource for city-states, and its presence or absence can shape the development and prosperity of a city. The proximity to water sources allows for agricultural productivity, trade opportunities, and the overall sustenance of the population. Balancing the management of water resources becomes essential for ensuring the resilience and long-term viability of these cities.

\textbf{Trade Routes}: Mesopotamia was a hub of trade and commerce, with city-states strategically located along major trade routes. Control over these routes allowed cities to amass wealth through taxation and control over the flow of goods. Conflicts often arose when city-states sought to gain or maintain control over important trade routes, leading to clashes between competing powers.  The war between Mari and Ebla: The cities of Mari and Ebla, prominent trade centers in the third millennium BCE, engaged in conflicts over control of trade routes in northern Mesopotamia. The aim was to secure access to lucrative trade networks and establish dominance over commerce.

\textbf{Political Influence and Prestige}: As city-states developed, they sought to expand their spheres of influence and establish political dominance. Wars and conflicts were fought to assert control over neighboring regions, extend political authority, and enhance the prestige of ruling elites. The conquest of other city-states was often seen as a display of power and a means to bolster the legitimacy and status of ruling dynasties.  The conquests of Sargon of Akkad: Sargon of Akkad (circa 2334-2279 BCE) is known for his military campaigns and the establishment of the Akkadian Empire. Through his conquests, Sargon sought to extend his political influence, enhance his prestige, and create a vast empire encompassing multiple city-states.

\textbf{Defending Independence}: City-states valued their autonomy and sought to protect themselves from potential threats. Wars were fought to defend against encroachment by rival city-states or external powers. Defensive alliances were often formed to counterbalance stronger adversaries and maintain independence.  The defense of Lagash against foreign invasions: Gudea, a ruler of Lagash (circa 2144-2124 BCE), is known for his efforts to defend the city-state against incursions by neighboring powers, including the city of Uruk. Gudea's inscriptions highlight his role in protecting the independence and sovereignty of Lagash.

\textbf{Ideological or Religious Differences}: While religious beliefs in ancient Mesopotamia were diverse, conflicts did arise due to religious or ideological differences. City-states with different religious practices and beliefs may have clashed over matters of faith, control of sacred sites, or conflicts arising from differing worldviews.  The conflicts between Ur and Uruk: The cities of Ur and Uruk had differing religious practices and cults associated with their patron deities. While specific historical events from this period are not well-documented, clashes between these cities over religious or ideological differences may have occurred as a result.

\section*{Trade Routes}
During the period between 4000 BCE and 3400 BCE in Mesopotamia, trade routes played a crucial role in facilitating commerce and cultural exchange. While specific details regarding the scale of trade and the exact amounts of money traded are not available, we can discuss some of the significant trade routes based on their importance and influence during that time.

\textbf{Euphrates River Trade Route}:
The Euphrates River served as a vital trade route connecting various cities in Mesopotamia. It provided a means of transportation for goods, including agricultural products, textiles, metals, and luxury items. This trade route can be classified as a big route due to the extensive trade and connectivity it facilitated across the region.  The Euphrates River was a major artery for trade in ancient Mesopotamia. It provided a vital transportation route for goods between cities such as Uruk, Lagash, Nippur, and Ur. Along this route, agricultural produce, textiles, pottery, and other goods would have been transported by boats and barges. The Euphrates River trade route enabled trade within Mesopotamia itself, connecting key economic centers.

\textbf{Tigris River Trade Route}:
Similar to the Euphrates River, the Tigris River also served as an important trade route connecting cities and regions within Mesopotamia. It facilitated the movement of goods, resources, and people, supporting trade and cultural interactions. This trade route can also be classified as a big route considering its significance in regional trade.  Similar to the Euphrates, the Tigris River served as an important trade route, linking cities like Nineveh, Assur, and Babylon. It facilitated the movement of goods, including agricultural products, metals, and luxury items. The Tigris River trade route contributed to the economic integration of these cities and fostered trade relations across the region.

\textbf{Overland Trade Routes}:
In addition to the river routes, overland trade routes played a role in connecting different regions. These routes linked cities such as Uruk, Lagash, Nippur, and Ur, facilitating the exchange of goods and ideas. While the scale of trade on these overland routes may have varied, they can be classified as medium-sized routes.  Overland trade routes played a significant role in connecting Mesopotamian cities. These routes involved land travel and enabled the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultural influences. While specific details from this early period are scarce, overland routes connected cities like Uruk, Lagash, Nippur, and Ur. These routes would have seen the movement of goods such as textiles, pottery, metals, and agricultural produce.

\textbf{Trade with Distant Regions}:
During this period, trade connections extended beyond Mesopotamia to regions like Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and the Iranian Plateau. Trade caravans transported goods such as metals, textiles, and luxury items over longer distances. While the exact scale of trade with these regions is challenging to quantify, it can be considered as medium-sized or small routes due to the greater challenges and risks associated with long-distance trade.  There is limited evidence of direct trade connections to regions as far as Mongolia and China. However, it is worth noting that the ancient Silk Road, which later emerged as a major trade route linking East Asia with the Mediterranean, potentially had early roots in trade connections between Mesopotamia and Central Asia. Over time, as civilizations expanded and trade networks grew more extensive, it is conceivable that indirect trade links and the exchange of goods occurred over longer distances.

Trade connections with neighboring regions, such as Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), the Levant (Eastern Mediterranean), and the Iranian Plateau, were significant during this period. These regions would have been engaged in trade relationships with Mesopotamia, exchanging goods such as metals, raw materials, luxury items, and agricultural produce.

While the scale and exact details of trade during this era remain speculative, the Euphrates and Tigris River trade routes, along with overland trade routes, played vital roles in facilitating regional commerce and cultural exchange within Mesopotamia. Although direct trade connections to distant regions like Mongolia and China are not well-documented during this time, it is within the realm of possibility that indirect trade links existed, laying the foundation for future trade networks that would emerge in later periods.

The image below highlight the scarse documented Trade Routes and the typically traded products.  This gives us an idea of how important it was to make a civilization prosper or fail and the power it had over people's lives.

One of the Order's key strengths lies in their ability to manipulate and influence the political and religious landscape of the region. Through their connections and subtle machinations, they can shape the decisions and actions of powerful individuals, ensuring the secrecy and protection of their activities.

However, the Order's pursuit of forbidden knowledge has led some of its members down darker paths. There are factions within the society that engage in rituals and practices that border on the occult, even delving into forbidden arts that some would consider dangerous or heretical. This aspect of the Order's activities remains hidden from the general membership, known only to those within the inner circle.

The Order of the Veiled Eye is an enigmatic and mysterious organization, shrouded in secrecy and ancient wisdom. They are willing to go to great lengths to safeguard their knowledge and ensure their continued existence. To cross paths with the Order is to risk stepping into a world of hidden truths, arcane rituals, and the ever-present threat of manipulation and danger.

\subsubsection*{Werewolf}
\subsubsubsection*{The Impergium}
The Impergium refers to the practice of culling the human population by the Garou, the werewolves of Werewolf: The Apocalypse, during prehistoric times.

During the Impergium, the Garou believed that the rapid expansion of humanity was causing harm to the natural world and disrupting the balance of Gaia, the Earth. To combat this perceived threat, the Garou engaged in a systematic culling of human populations. They targeted settlements, tribes, and communities, seeking to reduce human numbers and limit their impact on the environment.

The Red Talons, one of the tribes of werewolves, still advocate for a return to the Impergium in the present day. They believe that the uncontrolled spread of humanity has led to the corruption and degradation of nature, attributing the madness of the Weaver and the Wyrm, two powerful supernatural forces, to humanity's actions. The Red Talons see the Impergium as a necessary measure to restore the balance of Gaia and protect the natural world from further destruction.

The call for a return to the Impergium by the Red Talons reflects their deep commitment to preserving the wild places of the world and maintaining the delicate harmony between humans and the environment. They believe that by reducing the human population, the natural world can heal, and Gaia can regain her strength.

However, it is important to note that the Impergium is a controversial topic within the Garou Nation. Other tribes, such as the Children of Gaia, have different perspectives and advocate for more peaceful coexistence with humanity. The Impergium serves as a point of tension and ideological conflict within the game's lore, reflecting the complex relationship between humans, werewolves, and the supernatural forces that shape the World of Darkness.

The sandstorm, not so frequent by that time, creates a harsh and inhospitable environment to cross, isolating the wraiths within their respective Necropoli.

Despite the challenging conditions, ancient caravan lines traverse the sandstorm when any, established through centuries of use by Nabatean traders and devout living individuals. These pathways are vital for the transportation of the dead along trade lines and pilgrimage routes. Controlling these paths are ancient families of Ruh (Wraiths), who have thrived by providing services that ensure the safe passage of wraiths through the treacherous terrain.

These Ruh families have become intricately entwined with the business of ferrying the dead, utilizing their knowledge and experience to navigate the dangers of the sandstorm and guide wraiths to their intended destinations. They have established a network of trade and pilgrimage routes that offer both physical and spiritual connections between different Necropoli and the living world.

The Arabian Shadowlands present unique challenges and opportunities for the Ruh. They must contend with the unrelenting sandstorm and its effects on the landscape, while also navigating the intricate dynamics of trade, pilgrimage, and the delicate balance of power within their communities. The Ruh families hold significant influence and play a crucial role in facilitating the passage of the dead, maintaining connections between the realms of the living and the dead in the ever-shifting sands of the Arabian Shadowlands.

\textbf{Important}: The Keening begins only after Muhammad, the founder of Islam, conquered Mecca in the year 630 CE.  The Keening is a mysterious phenomenon that have different explanations:
a) It is believed to be a manifestation of Allah's power, originating from the Black Stone inside the Kaaba;
b) According to mages, the Keening is a result of wards set up by the Ahl-i-Batin using the power of the Web of Faith. These wards were meant to prevent Djinni and other evil spirits summoned during the Age of the Devil-Kings from entering the mortal realm. The screams heard within the Keening are said to be the tormented voices of the former Devil-Kings, enduring eternal suffering in Hell.

\subsubsubsection*{Dark Kingdom of Sand}
Amenti it's not populated by wraiths as we might think, but rather than this Immortals (Mummies), who died and found a way back in the Shadowlands.

The early human society in ancient Egypt was guided by the vampires Set and Osiris, who helped awaken individuals to the existence of the Duat, a realm where the dead had not completely abandoned the world. Mages like Isis had a deep understanding of the Duat and recognized its connection to the afterlife. When the first Immortal was given the Spell of Life, they ventured into the Duat equipped with knowledge and power.

Using the Hekau paths of Necromancy and Ushabti, the first Immortals were able to shape and strengthen the realms they discovered within the Duat. These realms were echoes of the living lands, formed by the passions and desires imprinted upon the great cities, tombs, and temples of the Kingdom. The substance of the Duat was malleable to the Immortals, allowing them to construct their own shadow realm known as Amenti. Amenti became a magnificent kingdom beyond the shroud, rich with its own unique features and inhabitants.

In later years, the Shemsu-Heru and the Ishmaelites shared their knowledge and skills with the other Dynasties, enabling each of them to establish their own shadow realms within the Duat. These shadow realms became extensions of their respective bloodlines, reflecting their unique traditions, beliefs, and ancestral connections.

The Duat and its shadow realms, including Amenti, served as sanctuaries and centers of power for the Immortals, allowing them to navigate the realms of the dead and maintain a connection with the living world. These realms were not only places of residence but also sources of knowledge, magical power, and spiritual significance for the Immortals and their bloodlines.

\subsubsubsection*{Dark Kingdom of Ivory}
The Shadowlands of Africa exhibit a predominantly rural landscape. While pockets of civilization reflect the same decay and dilapidation seen in other Dark Kingdoms, the vast stretches of vegetation and wildlife, known as the Bush, bear a striking resemblance to their living counterparts. On clear days, beams of sunlight manage to pierce through the Shroud, illuminating the sky above. Even ancient trees that have long vanished from the Skinlands thrive with vitality within the depths of the Bush. However, despite its outwardly vibrant appearance, the Bush exudes an eerie and foreboding aura, prompting amambo to hesitate before venturing through its expanse without companions.

The Bush of Ghosts finds itself encircled by the Ocean, akin to the Sea of Shadows. Unlike the turbulent Tempest that envelops Stygia and certain other Dark Kingdoms, navigating Byways through the Ocean proves to be an exceptionally challenging task. These elusive pathways are almost impossible to locate, and only the most focused and instinctual amambo possess the ability to find their way through the ever-shifting currents of the Ocean.

\subsubsection*{Demons}
The Demons that can be read in Demon The Fallen are still closed inside The Abyss and are only able to escape after The Sixth Great Maelstrom.  But there are older demons summoned by mages to Earth called \textbf{Earthbounds}.  Those are Distorted and grotesque beings, ravaged by the relentless grip of Torment and driven to madness through their perverse acts and twisted devotions.

Rather than occupying human vessels, these entities find refuge within inanimate objects known as reliquaries. Whether it be due to their overwhelming power that surpasses mortal endurance, a binding ritual that confines them to such objects, or the unavailability of a suitable new human host, they now exist within these vessels as their new abode.

Their presence can be anywhere on Earth though along the Middle East is more likely to find because it was the region where ancient people began and also believed to be the region where The Garden of Eden was.

The Earthbound, powerful and malevolent entities, hold significant influence over the world. Among them, the most formidable are the Archdukes, the Five Lieutenants of Lucifer:


\textbf{Abaddon}: A Rabisu who conspired with Asmodeus to replace humanity with the nephilim.

\textbf{Asmodeus}: A Neberu whose visions foresaw humanity's ascendancy over the Elohim, fueling his hatred towards them.

\textbf{Azrael}: A Halaku who aided in perfecting the nephilim and now collects their souls after their destruction.

\textbf{Belial}: A Lammasu who was once Lucifer's most loyal supporter but has become his fierce adversary as the "Great Beast."

\textbf{Dagon}: An Annunaki who advised and had a close relationship with Lucifer. He seeks to transform humanity into soulless, mechanical beings, aligning with the future Technocracy defines as their ideals.


Other notable Earthbound include:

\textbf{Avitu}: A former Angel of Knowledge and Understanding turned Demon of Ignorance.

\textbf{Baal}: A Rabisu who claims Archduke status despite originally being a lowly fell knight. He has amassed considerable power through his assertions.

\textbf{Beelzebub}: A high-ranking Rabisu of the Alabaster Legion, known as the "Lord of the Flies," who delves into the cycle of life within the bodies of other creatures.

These Earthbound hold considerable sway, each with their own goals and agendas, shaping the supernatural landscape with their dark influence.
