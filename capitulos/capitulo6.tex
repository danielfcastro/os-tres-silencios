\section*{The 2\textsuperscript{nd} generation}
I hold memories of all my children and grandchildren, though you may come across various accounts and texts that have been scattered across the land due to The Deluge and the Fall of the Second City. The records I am about to share come from the annotations I entrusted to Marduk, with the directive to safeguard them in a library far removed from the known lands of Nod and Mesopotamia.

These records, comprised of clay tablets and scrolls, are not easily portable. To ensure their safety, we established a temporary safehouse in the region beyond the Caspian Sea, near the Carpathian Mountains. It required long and frequent journeys with caravans that traversed the region. My loyal servant Jabal personally oversaw this mission.

Regarding Keturah and Naram-Sin, their origins and fates have been recounted. They both live on. Keturah has settled in Europe, leading a reclusive existence and raising progeny. Naram-Sin, on the other hand, ventured to the east. The last I heard, he was in the vicinity of Mongolia, but he travels alone without any progeny. They, too, have been subject to the curse, albeit only the aspect that weakens generation after generation.

Certain names mentioned here may appear unfamiliar, as the tales intentionally diverge in their depictions. This deliberate divergence arises from an understanding that names hold power, a wisdom I acquired from a Mummy. Some of my descendants have taken great care to create different versions of their history and name, ensuring that they become legendary figures within their own right, safeguarding their identities from those who might seek to locate and confront them.

However, there was a time when they did not possess this wisdom or intent, and they were known by the mortal names listed below.

\subsection*{Zillah}
\label{Zillah}
Zillah, the first, held a special place in Caine's heart.

\end{table}

According to Shamash, Zillah sired the Antediluvians that would be the founders of clans: \textbf{Nosferatu}, \textbf{Followers of Set}, and \textbf{Assamite}. She was a skilled hunter known for seeking out and confronting the most formidable creatures in the world. Her lineage possesses the Discipline of Obfuscate, a potent hunting skill shared by the Nosferatu, Followers of Set, and Assamite Clans, forming what is known as the \textit{Hunter Lineage}.

Zillah is also rumored to have possessed the "Gift of Prophecy," much like Saulot, possibly stemming from her mastery of Auspex. In the City of Enoch, she was even honored with a small pool named after her, the Pool of Zillah. It was said that this pool contained crystal clear water that bestowed visions of the future to those who possessed the ability to see them.  Her origin is explained along the book.

\subsubsection*{History}
The king of the First City, and his people revered Caine and recognized his immense power. When Caine returned to the mortal world, Enoch willingly relinquished his kingship and bestowed it upon Caine, making him the new ruler of the First City. In return, Enoch yearned for the same power and beseeched Caine for the Embrace. Despite the objections of the archangel Uriel, Caine granted Enoch's request and embraced him. In honor of Enoch, the First City was renamed the City of Enoch, and Caine governed it until the fateful Great Deluge.

Enoch's wisdom proved invaluable to Caine, serving as his trusted advisor. It was believed that Enoch's childer would inherit a similar form of insight. The Discipline of Auspex, which grants heightened perception and seer-like abilities, is shared among their children, the Antediluvians that would be the founders of clans: \textbf{Toreador}, \textbf{Malkavian} and \textbf{Salubri} who would possess the qualities of seers, forming what became known as the \textit{Seer Lineage}. These childer would carry forth the legacy of their sire as visionaries and advisers within vampire society.

\subsubsection*{History}\hspace{10pt}
Known as \textbf{The Strong}, was one of the Second Generation vampires and the third to be embraced by Caine, not the second as many documents affirms.

In the ancient nights when the dark city of Enoch stood proud, Irad, known as The Strong, emerged as a titan among mortals. His colossal physical strength was matched only by his unwavering will. As the third of Caine's child, contrary to some misinformed documents, Irad's tale began with a moment of profound significance.

The embrace of Irad was orchestrated at the behest of Enoch, the second-generation vampire seeking companionship among the Kindred. Enoch recognized in Irad the potential for immense physical power, making him a formidable weapon in Caine's service. The circumstances surrounding Irad's embrace unfolded in the shadowy recesses of Enoch's haven, a hidden chamber where the powers of the supernatural and the ancient flowed like the blood that would soon bind sire to progeny.

It was in this clandestine setting, enveloped by the ancient whispers of Enoch's lair, that Irad's fate was sealed. The air crackled with a preternatural energy as Caine, the dark progenitor, and Enoch, his second child, initiated the ritual of the embrace. Irad, chosen for his unparalleled strength, stood at the threshold between mortality and immortality.

As the dark vitae flowed from Caine, an otherworldly force accompanied the embrace. Shadows danced in an eerie display, and the very air resonated with the power being unleashed. It was said that the walls of Enoch's haven seemed to pulse with a dark heartbeat, bearing witness to the supernatural convergence that marked Irad's transformation.

In that pivotal moment, Irad embraced his destiny with a stoic resolve. His mighty frame, bathed in the otherworldly glow of the embrace, displayed an acceptance of the power coursing through his veins. The physical metamorphosis was accompanied by an inner transformation, as the vampiric curse intertwined with the mortal essence of Irad.

In the dimly lit chamber where Irad's fate intertwined with the embrace, a crescendo of supernatural phenomena unfolded, casting an eerie and terror-laden atmosphere. As the vitae of Caine coursed through Irad's veins, the air turned frigid, as if the very essence of the dark embrace had drained warmth from the surroundings. The once-still air became laden with an unnatural chill, causing visible mist to curl and dance in ghostly patterns.

Simultaneously, the flickering torches lining the chamber's walls dimmed and brightened in erratic pulses, casting unsettling shadows that seemed to take on a life of their own. Thunderous echoes reverberated through the hidden recesses of Enoch's lair, each ominous rumble resonating with the seismic shift occurring in Irad's very essence.

The supernatural ballet reached its zenith as Irad entered the first sleep as a vampire. The chamber, once touched by cold and tumultuous energy, now exuded an oppressive stillness. The shadows, once animated, clung to surfaces like silent sentinels, and the air itself seemed to hold its breath, awaiting the awakening of the newly born vampire.

And then, in a macabre dance of the arcane, Irad's eyes flickered open. No longer reflecting mortal warmth, they burned with an otherworldly intensity, a crimson glow that pierced the darkness like twin beacons of the abyss. The tormented storm outside mirrored the tempest within, marking the birth of The Strong in a symphony of supernatural terror that left an indelible mark on the Philosopher-Kingship Lineage.

The echoes of that fateful night reverberated through the ages, shaping the destiny of the clans and cementing Irad's legacy as The Strong.

Shulgi and Anahita, two star-crossed lovers, found themselves bound together in an eternal embrace as Second Generation vampires. They became the \textbf{King and Queen of Enoch} after Enoch himself relinquished his power to attend more the needs of his supernatural nature. Their story was one of profound love and sorrow, marked by the painful realization that their immortal existence would forever deny them the joys of parenthood.

After centuries of relentless searching, Shulgi and Anahita faced the agonizing truth that their immortal condition denied them the simple joy of conceiving a child in the conventional mortal way. Overwhelmed by the weight of their despair, they hatched a daring plan to escape their torment. Choosing to keep their immortal existence and far from their kin eyes, they meticulously orchestrated their own deaths, staging a tragic suicide that would serve as a catalyst for their ultimate quest for answers and resolution. In a carefully choreographed performance, they entrusted the semblance of their identities to two mortal vessels turned into vampires in secrecy, who took on their appearances and carried out the charade in the watchful eyes of their kin, all commanded by their real masters Shulgi and Anahita.

The climactic moment arrived as the fake Shulgi and Anahita were ceremoniously sealed within the confines of a towering prison near the Palace of Cain.

\section*{The Aralu}
After the end of Enoch the city was transported, somehow, to the other side.  Enoch appeared as a ghost town in a place called The Sea of Shadows.  Later it became The Tempest after the Third Great Maelstrom.

The Shadowlands, existing above the tempestuous realms of the Underworld, remain untouched by its chaotic storms. Unlike the twisting maelstroms that define the Underworld and the impenetrable shroud that separates the Skinlands from the Shadowlands, the Shadowlands retain a unique position, suspended between the realms of the living and the true depths of Oblivion. Prior to the cataclysmic events of the Third Great Maelstrom, travel and interaction between the Shadowlands and the Underworld were more accessible, facilitating a connection between these ethereal realms.

The Sea of Shadows, nestled within the desolate depths of the Underworld, stands as a chilling testament to despair and desolation. In this frigid expanse, light is but a distant memory, extinguished by the oppressive darkness that pervades the region. Even the mystical lanterns of the Ferrymen, known for guiding lost souls, lose their luminescence, leaving the Sea of Shadows shrouded in impenetrable gloom. The only source of eerie illumination emanates from sickly green Spectre-fire, casting an otherworldly glow upon the desolate landscape.

This treacherous domain is primarily inhabited by Spectres, malevolent entities that writhe and seethe just above the dreaded Labyrinth. Serving as a formidable barrier, they ward off intruders who are unprepared to face the harrowing realm of Spectredom. However, the Spectres eagerly draw in souls that are ready for their dark transformation, dragging them deep within the Sea of Shadows. There, these unfortunate souls face a grim fate, either succumbing to the influence of the Spectres and becoming one of them or being delivered directly into the clutches of Oblivion itself.

Within this forsaken region, two powerful whirlpools dominate opposite ends of the Labyrinth, acting as relentless vortices that pull anything adrift in the Sea of Shadows into their abyssal depths. These swirling forces symbolize the ever-present danger that lurks in this desolate expanse, serving as a stark reminder of the unforgiving nature of the Underworld.

Along the transportation of Enoch to the Sea of Shadows all of what lied within the premises of Enoch appeared also the same way they existed in skinland.  There comes the tale of the Aralu.

Along the downfall of Enoch (first city) some invaders found their demise while fighting the powerful vampires that dwelled there.  The recent tales from Nodists and others that seek for the truth of what happened by that time came with some hypothesis that Aralu could be some Elders that are sleeping in Torpor.  They only saw the names  Nergal, Ninmug, Loz, and Al-Marhi.  Some of them claim that those names relate with members of the third generation, some associate with the second or even Cain himself but the truth is far from that.  When the Order of the Veiled Eye knew what was happening they ceased the opportunity to take the city to make of it a headquarter for the Order.

Four high order mages appeared and infiltrated the Underground Necropolis unaware about the deluge that would come.  Their role was still to be defined.  Two of them Nephandi holding each one an artifact they called a relic able to draw energy from the surroundings and transfer to the holder.  Other two Marauders that for unknown reasons were allied of the first two.  They were unaware of the weird nature of the Necropolis and tried to use the abandoned lair of the Cappadoccian as a hidden place for their plan, to harness the energy of the city and shield it from the eyes of the world.  Creating the perfect refugee for their order and machinations.

As they set their plan in motion, they begin to harness the energy of the Shadowlands and encompass the city with it. The four magicians formed a circle, held hands and energy flowed through them.  As they extracted the energy from their surroundings all of the four mages, living beings, began to change into something unnatural, liches.  Remember that energy passed by them.  Ashur was observing everything from far, Shamash hidden in shadow and working together with Ashur waited for the right moment to act.  

As the mages saw what was happening with them they despaired and that was the opportunity waited by Ashur.  He was able to quickly, with the assistance of Shamash, stab all of them and seal into 4 coffins.  That coffins magically came to existence the names of their occupants: Nergal, Ninmug, Loz, and Al-Marhi.  

Ashur held the hand of Shamash and quickly lead the way out of the city.  Enoch was a time bomb with such a quantity of death energy and the time grew thin as the relics began to work without a holder.  Ashur and Shamash were barely able to leave the city as huge quantity of water flooded the streets and underground. As the water rose and the last two of the vampires strugled to find a way to survive it, the city began to fade and disappeared, appearing in the botton of The Sea of Shadows.

\section*{The 3\textsuperscript{rd} generation}
Saulot was the first to arrive and initiate the organization of a new haven for his fellow siblings after the cataclysmic Deluge. The Heaven, their former refuge and the place where the remaining second-generation elders had once thrived, miraculously emerged unscathed from the watery onslaught.

Unaware of the events that transpired, Saulot ventured forth, encountering waterlogged soil and lifeless bodies along his path, victims of drowning. He followed the trail that led to the remnants of the city of Enoch, only to find a desolate expanse, marked by the indelible traces of a once-great metropolis that had long vanished. The outline etched in the earth stood as a testament to Enoch's former presence.

Driven by determination, Saulot continued his journey, seeking out untouched lands that had been spared by the devastating flood. Eventually, he discovered a location far removed from Enoch. There, he embarked on a mission to persuade merchants, citizens, workers, and leaders to abandon their homes and contribute to the construction of a new city. Ashur and Shamash were among the next siblings to join Saulot, followed swiftly by the rest, who added their resources and manpower to the collective effort. It took 104 years of unwavering dedication, but the result was a marvel befitting the grandeur and wisdom of the legendary city of Enoch.

However, despite the initial intent to honor Enoch's splendor, the descendants of Cain lacked the necessary harmony and wisdom to ensure the city's longevity. Regrettably, the new city's existence paled in comparison to that of Enoch, persevering for only a fraction of the time its predecessor had stood.

As you can see, many of the cultures and peoples that reside in my grandchildren's official stories did not exist at the time of their embraces. This was deliberate, purposeful on their part. I'll tell the story before this part.

Haqim, a formidable warrior and strategist from ancient Mesopotamia, has caught the attention of Zillah, a powerful second-generation vampire. Zillah was attracted to Haqim's exceptional qualities, which played a key role in his joining the vampire bloodline. It happened near the Tigris River, when he was talking to his parents about how they could become stronger as a people and how to organize themselves. The crowd was excited by the knowledge and the way he conveyed each word, as if he was cultivating each syllable before speaking it.

The embrace of Haqim by Zillah took place during a critical juncture in vampire history. Perhaps there was a looming threat or a power struggle within the vampire society that necessitated the recruitment of individuals with extraordinary abilities.

With Set under her guidance, Zillah could direct his efforts towards specific targets and objectives, harnessing his ability to exploit existing tensions, manipulate factions, and incite conflict to further their goals.

Rather than allowing Set to operate independently and potentially pose a threat to their plans, Zillah sought to integrate him into their network of influence, ensuring that his actions would be coordinated and controlled. In doing so, she recognized the value of having Set as a trusted ally, whose mastery of chaos could be wielded as a potent weapon in their ongoing struggle for power and dominance.

Through careful manipulation and strategic planning, Zillah endeavored to keep Set under her watchful eye, guiding his actions and ensuring that his formidable abilities were utilized in service of their shared objectives. In this way, she sought to mitigate the risk of Set becoming a rogue element and instead channel his chaotic energy towards advancing their mutual interests, thereby strengthening their position within the intricate web of vampire politics and power struggles.

Marduk's eyes conceal in some level his inner monstruosity. The intensity of their stare, laced with an enigmatic magnetism, hinted at the profound insights and dark truths that lay concealed within their ancient soul.

His countenance shows a certain presence of sadism and a peculiar taste for unusual things. The carved lines of his face show the consequences of his carvings and creations made of flesh.  His arts were more than picturesque.  He was avoided due the bizarre and exquisite.  Gathering dead animals and sometimes humans he mastered taxidermy and combined different bodies to create master pieces of the grotesque.

Enheduanna heard about that and decided to investigate.  Eventually she got a meeting with Marduk and saw in his unusual work means to instigate fear over the enemies and decided that he could be a valuable asset into the group she and her siblings are assembling.

His innate abilities as a leader and enforcer made him an indispensable asset to the powerful Cainite lineage. Serving as Enoch's proxy in the First City, he commanded respect and instilled a sense of order among the populace.

On the fateful night preceding the cataclysmic Deluge, Caine bestowed upon Omar a sacred task of utmost importance – to become the caretaker and guardian of Caine's descendants. This significant responsibility included the protection and guidance of his own sire, Enoch, as well as the preservation of the bloodline that traced back to the ancient progenitor. Omar accepted this charge with profound reverence, understanding the weight of his duty in safeguarding the legacy of their kind.

Omar's encounters with Caine, both as a youth and as a trusted confidant, solidified his unique position as the last Cainite to witness the progenitor before the impending Flood. These encounters would forever shape the destiny of the clans and set in motion the events that would unfold in the centuries to come.

In the annals of vampire history, Omar's story remains a testament to his unwavering loyalty, unwavering dedication, and unyielding determination. His physical attributes, derived from his Egyptian origins, mirrored the grandeur of a civilization steeped in mysticism and splendor. As the custodian of Caine's descendants, his role would transcend time and serve as a pivotal link connecting the ancient past with the uncertain future of the Cainite bloodline.
